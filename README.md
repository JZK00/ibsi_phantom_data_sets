# IBSI data sets
This repository contains the datasets used by the Image Biomarker Standardisation Initiative for standardisation and validation of image processing algorithms and radiomics feature computation.

Additional information is provided for each dataset.

Maybe we can do some radiomcis or reconstruction researches using these phantom data.
Please list the related references when use the data.
